1) Improved System Security:
The firewall adds a layer of defense by blocking unauthorized access and potentially malicious traffic based on IP or port.
Reduces risk from common attacks like port scanning, brute force, or unauthorized remote connections.

2) Practical Understanding of Network Security:
Gives hands-on experience with core networking concepts: ports, protocols, and IP filtering.
Familiarizes you with how firewalls actually work, beyond theory.

3) Foundation for Advanced Security Projects:
This project acts as a stepping stone toward more complex tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or SIEM solutions.
Helps in understanding enterprise-level tools like iptables, ufw, or even firewalld.

4) Automation of Security Tasks:
By using Python, you automate firewall rule management—something that’s typically done manually.
In a larger environment, this approach can save time and reduce errors.
