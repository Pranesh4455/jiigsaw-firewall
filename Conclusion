Important Notes:

1.Root privileges: The script uses sudo to execute iptables commands, so youâ€™ll need root access to modify firewall settings.

2.Testing: Always be careful when modifying firewall rules, especially on remote servers. It can lock you out if you accidentally block your own access.

Next Steps:

1.Extend the firewall: You can extend this script by adding logging features to track blocked IPs or ports.

2.GUI Interface: If you're comfortable with GUI programming, you could build a graphical interface using Tkinter or PyQt to make it more user-friendly.

3.Advanced Filtering: Add filtering for protocols (UDP, ICMP, etc.), or allow more specific rule creation (like restricting access based on the time of day).
