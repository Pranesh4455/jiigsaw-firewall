We'll use iptables on Linux for managing the firewall rules, but you can interact with it via Python using the subprocess module.

Pre-requisites:
1)Linux Operating System (as iptables is a Linux tool).

2)Python 3.x installed.

3)Root/Administrator privileges to modify firewall settings.

4)Familiarity with basic networking concepts (IP addresses, ports, protocols).
